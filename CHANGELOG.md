I'd be happy to help you write release notes! However, I need some information first.

Could you please clarify what changes or version you'd like me to write release notes for? I can help with:

1. **Specific version** - If you have a version number or release in mind
2. **Recent changes** - I can analyze recent commits and changes
3. **Specific features** - If you want to highlight particular improvements

From the git status, I can see there are several modified files and recent commits. Would you like me to:
- Write release notes based on the recent commits shown in the git log?
- Focus on specific features or changes you have in mind?
- Something else?

Please let me know which approach would be most helpful!

I'd be happy to help you write release notes! However, I need more information about what changes or features you'd like to document.

Could you provide:
- The version number for this release
- What changes, features, or bug fixes should be included in the release notes
- Any specific areas or components that were updated (e.g., UI improvements, new capabilities, bug fixes)

Alternatively, if you'd like me to extract recent changes from git history or existing documentation, I can help with that too. Just let me know your preference!
